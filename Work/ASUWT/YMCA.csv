I like being able to print and work on things in the CSI
"It is a great place to network with fellow students, learn about how to get involved, and a comfortable place to study."


They are easy going and fast workers and helped me to get items printed or if I needed something with the center.

"Calm, Casual"
Good


"No option to click “none”, I use the Morgan YMCA"

It was for Day of Caring and it was fun. I don't think this counts but it wouldn't let me submit my answers without something picked
"It's good, I like the facilities"
Great! I wish I had time to go more

Love the amount of gym equipments they provide and free activity classes for us students
It is super good and a well kept facility 10/10
Too many people
Never actually used any health and wellness service but there was no option for that.
"Good, I’ve been working out there throughout the year"


It was good 
"Didn’t really impact me much, was more so a place to relax and hang out with my friends, but we go less frequently/almost never now because we don’t want to walk up the hill"

It was great ! It was clean staff was friendly. 

It where I work and hangout with other organizations. Also Y membership works at my hometown too!
I enjoyed my time working out. 

Good environment and many resources.

"The YMCA is fantastic with numerous well-equipped facilities, excellent trainers, and complimentary classes. It’s truly impressive!"

"I enjoy going to the YMCA, I always go when I want to work out and also utilize the CSI when I want to study as well."
I wish the school would be more upfront that it is a separate charge in the tuition statement. A lot of people think it’s included in tutition. But I do think the Y center has been helpful for me to feel more connected to my school. I also love the gym and The workers do their job well. 
"I like that it is not as busy creates a calm atmosphere for me, and lets me enjoy working out."




Great resource
"My experience using the YMCA Student Center is fantastic every single time. The free printing and access to craft supplies are what makes the center the great resource that it is. The staff are also always friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable. "

"Very good, although I notice that the student center is unused most of the time, and I wonder if the removal of it would allow for the UWY fee to be lowered."
I go to use the gym sometimes and I like the use of their memberships
It is an amazing center for students with all the required equipment and helpful staff.
Great! It seems a bit intimidating at first but everyone is really nice and it's a good place to make friends and talk to UWT departments.

Overall very positive. 
the Y was very welcoming and a great environment to work out or to have a space to study.
People there are very helpful 
It's amazing 



The YMCA has been great.



It was great! i felt secure there for sure. 
I have went with friends and just myself to exercise here. I liked the facilities and the employees are welcoming and helpful.
I love the community and sports 
It’s very nice having a space to decompress and work out while on campus. I enjoy the events that YMCA holds. I think it would be so great if the Y had a sauna! Saunas are so good for your overall health 
Go to gym there is great

Very good
"I go there all the time! I think that place is great for so many things. It’s inclusive, has plenty of space and equipment for lots of people, and my favorite which are free classes (of many varieties) free to us students."

It was a really good experience to connect with other students. 
I love going to my YMCA. I have been going there since I was little but stopped because I couldn’t afford it. Now I go there whenever I can with my dad.

Positive and safe experience. Cultivates a good space that promotes physical and mental health. It is also very clean and hygienic. 
Smooth and painless!  The facilities were very nice.
Good workouts often


It was good! The ability to use the YMCA membership at any of the branches has been a great help in making it easy to work out.

Its a great place for me to let of steam only been there once but i plan to go there more often 


My experience was great.

I have not used any of these resources but I would like to use some at some point.
Got a Y Card
I went to get a Y card that’s it 

Pretty good I like going to the gym after class

It is a great resource to help me get active. When I got injured it was great to know there’s a free resource available to me to help me recover from my injuries and stay active. 
"I've only visited once to sign up, but I'm glad to have this resource available. "

"Great, I love the gym there and all it has to offer."

It was very clean and spacious. I would have liked there to be more machines for weights since its very full at most times which can make it hard to do any work outs.
"It was okay, the downstairs weight lifting is usually packed with students, so it is a little intimidating. Though all the other amenities upstairs and above are well maintained and equipped. It is very spacious and clean. Staff are nice."

I went to the YMCA Student Center a few times and had a positive experience. 

Amazing. The YMCA is an excellent place to exercise and play basketball.



Awesome. Love the gym and court there.
It was pretty chill actually.
Great facility for working out 
One of my favorite resources. I love being able to use the YMCA gym.

"I haven't actually used it. There wasn't a ""NONE"" option."
The ymca is great. Good equipment and good staff.
Very good
I go to the YMCA about a couple times a week for soccer and working out. I am so intrigued by how many appliances the YMCA has and how respectable and welcoming the staff memebers are. It is also the first place where I really connected with other students and was able to find my community and place at UW Tacoma.
Very good. 



"I wanted to share my experience using the University YMCA Student Center. It has been an incredible resource for me. The welcoming atmosphere and the support from the staff have made my time there truly positive. From study spaces to recreational activities, the center provides a well-rounded environment that enhances the university experience. I highly recommend exploring what the University YMCA Student Center has to offer."



I had a good experience utilizing the University YMCA. It provided a safe space to both study with larger groups and provided many different physical activities to engage in when taking a break.
Very great facility has a really great gym that I utilize a lot. There is also much more to do and I heard that they do lessons for certain topics.

"Pleasant, there are many facilities for both studying and exercise."
I’ve only been there once and it was to get my YMCA card but the staff was pretty nice and helpful.   Survey makers you should add an option that says “I have not utilized any of these resources.” Just in case. 

Very easy to rent out the activities to use at the YMCA.
Pretty cool center. Has everything needed for a decent workout. I've heard clubs use the space as well for activities.
Good




I was pleasantly surprised by all the things that are offered to us students! I had no trouble using this resource.
It’s always been fairly easy and everyone has been friendly! 


Great place to go work out mostly. Also great service. 

"It was a good experience. I personally expected more. For so many floors and rooms, I had expectations of at least seeing a sauna, steam room, hot tub, or better yet a pool! Maybe not all of those things, but at least one of them. Apparently, I was told the pool is a couple blocks away, but that takes away the convenience of it. Also doesn’t seem to be apart of UW if it’s in a completely different area."
Good 
It was welcoming and fun.


"The YMCA is a service that many of us use either to distract ourselves in the gym or in any other activity they do there, like on Fridays going to play soccer that distracts you a little from all the stress of classes and is a unique and excellent service on campus"

It was fun!

It’s really cool to have the opportunity to have a free gym membership and to go to the Y for a quick workout or the here and there opportunities of meeting new people through the facilities offered and as well the bringing together of students for special events. 
"Pretty good, there are a lot of events and activities I can utilize"


"Good, the equipment is all in good shape and they have a good repertoire of activities to do. "


I like being active and the YMCA is a great resource to have on campus. It’s fun to go in and do some physical activity. I genuinely thank the university for providing this to their students.

Very good

It is fun
"Clean, beautiful facility. Lots of equipment available. Close to classes."
"A great way to get out and do something other than school, very helpful tool to stay healthy"


It was great!

"I haven't used any of the services, but there is no option to pick none."


"I haven't gone much but when I have it has been nice. The opportunity to workout is great, just wish I had the time to!   "
"The exercise machines and indoor track are very useful for getting some exercise in while on campus, alongside being able to workout with friends."

Excellent
It's good. I go there to work out aside from all the event hosted there. 




"Very good. I often like to use the gym in between classes. Last quarter I participated in a study group there, as well as played pool and the arcade game with friends. I intend to use more of the facilities in the future such as the basketball court and the boxing bags."
"I don't visit often but I have been there a few times to work out, and a few more times when there was UW Tacoma events like lights out. I enjoyed going to events and going on the rock wall. It helped me socialize and try new things. "



"Used the gym three times, I have a family and I should be able to bring my children for free. "

I haven't been but I heard nothing but good experiences. 
"I love the University Y, haven’t used the rock climbing wall but there’s tons of space and equipment for many things and a small cute piano room. The bathrooms are also clean and well maintained and so is the equipment."
"Easy, and comfortable."
nice I like how near by it is
"I love the YMCA gym, it helps me relieve stress from my academic schedule "
They are very inviting and informational.

i enjoy using the gym

The YMCA Center has been a place where I can use to improve my physical and mental health
I love using the Y at school because it creates an open space for us students to do homework and meet up with clubs for meetings/socializing. There's also obviously a gym we can use as well which helps me motivate myself to do better!
Very good! I like having access to the gym!






Excellent.
I used it to ask a question about something on new student prep day and it was pretty useful and easy to find.
"Good, everything was clean and there wasn't that many people"
It's pretty nice for anyone looking into fitness related activities and would want assistance in those activities
Best gym ever! It’s got everything you need to cater to your hobbies/ likings. 
Fun playing basketball


Welcoming and very friendly and easy to sign up at the YMCA

I have no used it yet but I love that it is available with our tuition and plan to in the future  
My experience is that sometimes I go to exercise and sometimes I don’t.


"10/10, great for printing.  Conor makes it an uncomfortable environment sometimes"
Great!

"Sometimes attending classes, or working out on my own. People at the desk are friendly, and the center is very clean"

Its great because I am getting big.


"The atmosphere is very nice, clean, and friendly. I enjoy my visit every time ."
"It’s good, inconvenient to need its own card tho"





"Good, the facility is very nice, but there is a lot of people when I go. I am not a fan of when it is very busy."



My experience has been good. The staff there is very friendly.
I love the community and being able to stay healthy and active with my fellow UW students 
As to be expected from a gym. The atmosphere is welcoming. No one makes you feel as if you do not belong.
Very clean and well-maintained facility with an adequate amount of equipment for how many people are in there on a normal basis.

normal gym experience   laser tag is fun
"I enjoy the YMCA, it helps me relieve stress and take my mind off my school work"

"My experience at the University YMCA student center was incredible. I got the chance to meet new people and Was able to get guidance from health instructors, and how to have a proper posture and not overwork myself."
Awesome space on campus for getting physical activity in. Would like if there were classes at UW that took advantage of the YMCA Student Center or ways in general to highlight it more during an education here. Otherwise it can be difficult to find time to visit
go to the gym whenever i can which is nice
I've only used the student center once when working on a group project but it was a nice environment with individuals there that were willing to help if need be. 
"My experience with the University YMCA Student Center is also great! Whenever I have the time or have breaks in between classes, I go to the YMCA as a stress reliever."
N/A

Very Fun and Rejuvenating for my physical and mental wellbeing.
I used the gym and it was easy to access. Item storage was also very convenient.
I work out there and it's great! 
Allows me an opportunity to meet new people and focus of my well being physically
"Amazing facility, hard to offer constructive criticism. "




"I love having the Y access! I use it to recreate at the Y near my house which is more convenient. I have utilized the Y on campus, including a basketball league last winter, when I could and it has allowed for me to make friends.  "


I don't often go to the YMCA but have stopped by to enroll into their program. The receptionist was very nice and informative about the different amenities and I know a lot of my peers use it as a good source or exercise and stress relief.

My favorite area on campus
The gym and the equipment they offer. 

"Nice if you have time to use it, doesn't really fit my schedule."

"I like swimming, I always go to YMCA in Lakewood with my University YMCA students "


"I've had nice experiences there, it's a great way to clear the mind and work on yourself during hard study periods."
This resource was convenient and straightforward to use with intended services but a lot of back and forth if any issues arise.


Great it’s awesome to have this source available through my tuition and find myself using it 3-4 times a week.

Great!

Membership is too expensive but I like that they have piano and volleyball courts and stuff.
I loved the experience! It is a nice facility where I can go and lift weights/exercise and talk to many people creating great relationships.
"I go most days I’m on campus, really friendly place"
I utilize the YMCA at a different location typically but find the University Y is great and nice with newer machines. I don't like the negative aura supplied by younger gym goers so I go to my local Y instead. 


"I honestly haven’t used it, I just needed to pick an option. I don’t think I’ve personally used any of these services."


It's good from equipment and space aspects. The only concern is that sometimes there are more people from outside the uwt community. 


"I sometimes use it. Many wish that it was not an automatically charged membership and want it to be optional. I enjoy having the option to go, though I'm not sure if my membership will automatically expire once I graduate or not."

"Good, Wish it was 24/7"
I feel like it was nice and a pretty unique experience due to the entire community being related to uw tacoma

Felt like it could’ve been better. 












Good.

Love.

It was great to have such facilities at campus.

I lost 75 pounds while enrolled at UWT. I attribute this drastic change to my complimentary YMCA membership. I utilize this resource nearly every day. 
"I enjoy it, am using a professional trainer. "

I liked going to the YMCA to work out.
"I have used the membership at different locations, it is nice to have. "

Always great.
It was fine- not super one way or the other. I use it for its gym equipment.
I enjoy access to the gym courtesy of student membership included in tuition.





"It was great, loved this benefit. My mental health was a lot better attending without having to worry about whether I got enough to pay a membership or not."
Student staff are great. I end up using the hot tub at the YMCA down the street though.  

Printed my poster there

The YMCA student center has always been helpful and the resources I learn about are always beneficial.
I haven't really used this resource but it is the only one that I have been too and it this survey makes me select one. 

I use the gym when I have time
"It was pretty good, I don’t use it as much as I’d like given the hefty fee we pay as students."

Good

"Very pleasant, lots of exercising equipment, and very clean."
"Very nice place, makes it very nice to go to a gym and not have to pay for it. Makes UWT look like they truly care about their students"

Good
Very good. The staff was friendly.
"Has a good gym. I enjoy it, it comes with tuition and it offers a lot more than just the gym. Really fun place."


"I have been inside briefly, and plan to fully utilize the gym in time. But I mainly got familiar with the setting, and sat down to do homework."

I like the YMCA but use the one closer to where i live

Only used it a couple times


"I used the microwave, and used some tape"



Nice to get a workout in between classes
It is a safe place to work out. It was close to my classes and the people are very helpful there


It was awesome. I wish it was available to all graduate students.
"My experience with using the YMCA Student Center consists of walking in the door to ask about pricing, and then leaving so far, as I do not have a membership."

The range of options available at the YMCA are fantastic. As I climber I also enjoy the rock wall





"Great, easy , and accessible "

"I have had no difficulty using the facility. Simply check in with my membership card, go get set up in the locker room and then choose my workout and finish up and pack up and leave. Easy."
It helps give me a time to focus on work when my roommate is having friends over.
"Nice and convenient, sometimes too busy though"

I go to the gym regularly. It helps me stay fit and relax.
I haven't used any of these resources but that was not an option to choose.

"Excellent, I visit the YMCA often. "

Very nice and good overall. No complaints.
Good gym


"Good, but it should be less since public membership is less and school events are rarely held there and are needed for attendance. "

I went into the locker rooms to use the bathroom.

Great
"Clean, friendly, I felt welcome, and grateful that this beautiful space was made with students in mind. "
