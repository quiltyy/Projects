Disability Resources for Students: What was your experience like using that resource?















Great!
















Loveeeee! It’s amazing for my ADHD






Only contacted















Good.







Pretty good
















































They are excellent advocates for me
Great.
I was able to have an ESA however I feel like the process and asking for more than just a doctors note that says the ESA is needed pushes people away for asking for that resource. It’s also a bit discriminatory(?) when it comes to people who can’t afford healthcare but need the resources.

Good

Easy to use to request accommodations each quarter once the specific accommodations are sorted out. Staff are helpful and kind.
Very accommodating!!












"Great, much easier than I anticipated "


I was contacted immediately and the person who is my advisor checks in weekly. 


















"great, i love this resource"




Awful. It’s a poorly funded excuse for a DRS. The Seattle campus gets much more actually useful resources and accommodations for students. It’s a shame we can’t have that at Tacoma. 













Great resources for students with disabilities needing appropriate learning accommodations 






Excellent. 






"My last personal contact with them in 2023, caused me to feel unsafe. I avoid the place now. I will be working on reentering and using the space. Until then,  I will continue to avoid them as much as possible. "

DSS is a life saver and I have had a great experience with them so far.



Great






I was accommodated when I was in a car accident and suffered a concussion.
































"I used DRS for more time for testing, seating accommodations,  and I have been to embarassed to ask for a not taker due to my carpal tunnel. Need more promoting to stop stigmas put on disabilities.  "




























I utilize this for my accommodations and it’s helpful for my learning disabilities. 















Pretty good. It is a bit difficult to get started with them but the support they offer is very helpful.











Very supportive in the process of getting needed accommodation.

Helpful in advocating for disability students to their professors.















































































"So far, I have been fairly happy with "



Staff was super helpful and accommodating for my needs to help my school experience.


Good.


never








Pretty bad. I hate that you have to reapply for it every quarter and the resources they offer you are very limited and if you need anything more specialized or in depth you have to go to the Seattle campus to get it 











It's been great so far. No issues 
A variety of different types of therapy. Cognitive therapy does not work for all


























great

Excellent 











Fairly easy








Amazing accommodations 








"They empowered me to have options in the event of a crisis. Just having the ""out"" was enough to prevent severe panic attacks for me. "





"Awesome service, no issues."










Only stop by to drop off paperwork 
































Very helpful and intuitive. Online portal for simplicity and continuity


"This experience was good, I was able to get a lot of needed information but I didn't end up getting the services because the system was too complex for my needs.  "









It was very helpful and I felt supported and genuinely cared for. 







Good



























I have yet to consult the DRS office.







"Good Basic help for vision accommodation. Never was able to receive large printed books, syllabuses, complete articles and book excerpts for Nursing Classes. AI readers need improvement, or offering of more premium voices. "




I have worked with them for 2 quarters now. Victor and Heather have helped me with every request and have been very supportive. 


"I feel DRS and the process I have to do with each professor, filling out forms and meeting with professors is very overwhelming and time consuming. "























Simple and easy to access



very positive and educational 
Good











I love the team. Makes me feel - not alone in my journey with my disability.
