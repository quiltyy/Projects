It was cool because I wouldn’t normally go out of my way to go get them but because it was accessible at school it made it more appealing to get them.






Friendly and simple to get






good













Once and it was okay

























it was okay. didnt have any issues and they communicated everything necessary






















Na




I really appreciated this when it was more available. Sad it's gone. 



























































Very easy and simple way to find out if you have or have been exposed to Covid-19
"Not great. I signed up to get my flu shot for the fall quarter, and I received multiple emails about when and where the clinics were to be located at and was unable to find it and never got my flu shot."




The Clincs have been very helpful in helping me get vaccinated and reaching the immunization requirements for school. I’m grateful to the folks there because of their kindness and direction to other clincs when they didn’t have certain shots I needed.






It was good. Very welcoming and comfortable environment   



































"actually, I used the immunization vaccination only, on campus at least!"













nice


The chic was very fast and convenient. The staff was respectful and very skilled and proffesional. 









































































"I received a flu and covid vaccine this fall at one of the vaccine events.    It definitely was a better experience last school year 2022-2023 when UW Tacoma still had access to healthcare services.    This year it was provided by a staffing agency and the experience felt less professional. Additionally, it was announced shortly before the clinic date (but after signups) that only students with NO health insurance (including Medicaid / Apple) would be eligible to receive any kind of vaccine which I found ridiculous.    I am still grateful that I was able to receive vaccines for free as a UW student this year.  But am saddened and disappointed that UW Tacoma no longer has any real in person health services for students anymore. I hope that this can be changed as there are real health care inequities between students who have don't have access to healthcare from their parents or otherwise."
