    1. Problem Deifinition
        a. What problem are we trying to solve?
            - Supervised Learning
                Classification
                    Binary Classification
                    Multi-class Classification
                Regression
                    How much will this house sell for?
                    How many people will buy this app?
            - Unsupervised Learning
                Clustering   
            - Transfer Learning
                Taking another model and applying the model to another target
            - Reinforcement Learning
                Have a computer program do a task and giving a punishment or reward depending on their response
    2. Data
