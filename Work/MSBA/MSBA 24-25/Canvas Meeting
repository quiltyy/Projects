MSBA: Darcy Janzen Canvas Meeting - Wednesday December 4th 2024

Canvas Data collection:
Karan Roberts Tom Lewis etc. 
https://itconnect.uw.edu/it-at-the-uw/it-governance-and-policies/it-governance/
    - Are there any current plans to expand Canvas feature that are aligned to meet student needs?
        - Must identify what you mean by student need canvas has been very active in trying to expand.   We have a sub acccount on the Seattle service, and any features are decided and turned on by Seattle
        - 3rd party vendors MATLAB etc. must go through vetting with Seattle.
        (May need to be more directed towards the satelite cammpus)

TLC has a resources link, like Husky Cares or the Library

Data Available:
    A lot of the data is on a course by course basis
        - Ask faculty members to add us to the course so that we can run the course.
