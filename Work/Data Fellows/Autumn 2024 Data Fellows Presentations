--- Group #3 Tuition Projections Using Data Gathered ---
Zack and Zahara

Non-Resident Tuition was down, so our total + seemed lower than expected
School of Education Tuition Fees issue even though they had the same number of FTE
Tacoma, Resident, Undergraduate makes up 71% of tuition revenue up 3% from the previous years
Questions / Future Work - Check Validation of Workday vs. SDB - Incorporate UPASS fees

Alyce McNeil, Margaret Bullock, Nestor Enguerra

Included Covid years as a purposeful decision
Pacific Islander Students:
Encompases a large number of identification factors that are not deliniated in a number of surveys
Higher rates of women in higher education than men
African American Students:
Female students completing degrees earlier than male completions
First Time First Year African American Students are taking slightly longer than the average FTFY students
Questions / Future Work
Distinct Count issues / questions regarding accuracy when condensing records
More information needed in regards to income and financial aid

--- Group #5 How many multilingual students does UWT have? ---
Kelvin Keown - There isn't any data to analyze
More than surface diversity
National Higher Ed Data - 11% Linguistic Minorities 2012
US Census - Pierce County 16% of households speak a language other than english at home - King County 30% of households speak a language other than english at home
From admittance throughout career will need help - What programming do we have available for non-international ML (multi-lingual) students
Tricky to survey - Not just what languages, but with whom and how often - DSP as location to survey the students - Would not include Transfer students
