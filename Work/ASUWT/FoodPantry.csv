The Food Pantry: What was your experience like using that resource?










It was nice
Went on a low day when they didn’t have a lot


It was nearly empty but free is free
Great!

The people there were sweet and let us look around. Most of the time there was enough food to take home!

Quick and easy


It’s nice and quiet. It’s nicer that we all can share a designated area.





"It was okay, I didn’t get anything because there wasn’t a lot of things the day I went. "
It was great! They were really helpful and kind answering all the questions I had. 
Supplies ran out very quickly. always got the leftovers
It was amazing and helpful 
It was nice but I wish there were more options
It is good just you have to be there early if you want anything good.








Usually theres not much food :(


Really good!








"The experience was good, I'm grateful for the food"


Got decent food supplies and menstrual items from it.

Sometimes it’s not filled



Good





Come by for snacks every now and then. 
I didn’t feel insecure about taking food. 

Very nice resource but constantly low on supplies.







It was Awesome people there are supper nice and helpful
"Great! On some days I had to wait for restock because there wasn’t enough food, but overall a great experience."
There is not much food when we go in the afternoon. This is not a good resource.
"It was good, however not enough food for everyone "
Very good. I wish it was more stocked

The food pantry is a great resource. There are do many food items available and all the items are fresh and good.


"The pantry is well organized and clean, maintaining neat. Unfortunately, the restocking time usually coincides with my class schedule, so by the time I arrive, the shelves are usually almost empty."
Good
"It was pretty easy to use, and I'm glad we have it on campus. "

"Everytime I’ve gone to the pantry it has been good except, some days it is empty and it’s hard to time the right time because I’m not always on campus but when I do catch the restock I’m able to get food to support me through the next few days I’m on campus."


It is almost always empty and has a long line that is difficult to wait in because of my disability. Not a lot of gluten free options 

"Good, lots of healthy food options"
"My experience using the Food Pantry was extremely pleasant. The staff who scans my food is always very nice and welcoming. I feel supported and happy knowing that I have this great amenity on campus. As we know, being a college student is expensive and often we are left with very few money to spend. With this resource, I can find peace in knowing that I’ll never be hungry during  classes. My friends have also voiced their love and appreciation for The Food Pantry. It is loved by everyone."



It has been very helpful for basic Groceries and utilities.
Really long wait times due to demand and limited food options when you finally get in.
It was good I just needed a snack and remembered that we gave food pantry.



It's really great. Suggestion to include more quality breads 
Nice 
"Welcoming and positive. I went many times last quarter and many times there wasn’t much available, but due to my work, childcare, and class schedule I wasn’t able to wait in line the days they restocked. "


Very good! On my way there right now!



I go weekly to the pantry. I like the people who work there and the selections they provide especially since they have fixed their freezer.





I’ve been there a few times with my roommates and I really like how easy it is to access. They have a bit of variety of foods including some fresh produce which I love.



Good! I've gone there twice to get a snack.


Good food

It was effective and efficient 









"Pretty well, allows me plan my week in terms of food"
Pleasant 



"It was great, everything was very neat and well-organized, with edible food and microwave food and snacks for students. I believe a food pantry is good for many students who are trying to look for a quick snack and aren't trying to spend money. I worked in the UWT campus library, so I was able to find out most of them but only used Food Pantry. "





it was good. its a bit strict on what you can get though.


It was good! I was able to receive what I need whether needing a snack or a health remedy such as tea when sick. I sometimes have to drive far and have to be on campus king so don’t have time to pick up a meal so it is a good place to stop by. 






The staff are nice and I can usually find the food I'm looking for there.


It’s really good. Helps when you’re on campus with no food.
It was very accessible when needed and easy to find. Overall a decent experience.
It is a great source for those who are in need of food. 

It was great. Sometimes they were very low on food items which was a bummer


One of the most used resources for me. I am able to get some absolute essential items from the food pantry that sustain me for a week. 
I really enjoyed using the food pantry 







It was great!
I wanted to share my experience with The Food Pantry. The warmth of the staff and the variety of nutritious food made a tough time easier. It's not just a resource; it's a community that cares. Grateful for their support.
"Good, used once "



Not much options but great if your on the go and need something to eat. 
There was hardly any food typically
"Typically a nice experience, although the pantry was not open during some hours that I came in (despite being listed as an operating hour)"

It was great and I was able to get the food supplies and products that I needed.




NA
Useful and accessible to those that may seek it 

It was a very good resource! Especially during thanksgiving. It’s always sort of embarrassing to ask for help but they make it really easy and comfortable. 



Great service and usually have what I need!
It is good for the most part but options are very limited and it it often understocked.
"I’m grateful that UW has this program, but every time I have visited they don’t have much in stock. There’s no exact time for restocking. It’s a hit or miss when you get there. It’s makes my time there a bit unpleasant, because it’s very unpredictable if I will get food or not."


It has provided me with meals when I don't have food at home

My experience using this service was excellent since you find what you need for food and you can take advantage of it and it is one of the best services on campus
I liked it a lot but I wish there were broader options. I loved the fact that it is accommodating student who can’t afford to buy food 

Small

"Very positive, getting food is always nice to have on campus"


"Good, it has a useful variety of food to get, though I wish there were more fresh vegetable options"
It's good! Wish more people knew about it though - there's never that many people around when I go. I think it would really help those who needs it. No shame in receiving help. 




"Great, didn't feel judged for having to use the pantry. Comfortable and understandable environment."



It’s always busy 




I was running late so being able to grab quick food was very convenient.





It's pretty well. You pretty much just enter and grab whatever is available that you need. No questions asked.
"Very good but at times they have been unexpectedly closed without any indication i.e. note on door, website, or social media about change of schedule and could not be reached by email."




It can be less stocked on days that they don't get their supply replenished but it has always been a good resource when I am low on cash and need some basic food items to make meals for myself. 



"Need more options like refried beans in a can, tortillas, cheese."
"It was great to see all the free food we can get, a variety of different food. And some food offered were in great sizes. "

"It was great, the students who worked there were really nice and engaging and the pantry itself is a great service. The only issue is that food gets restocked on Tuesday and Thursday at random times and besides these unspecified times, the pantry gets relatively empty."



When I first visited it was closed but the second time I visited they were helpful and although a bit awkward they tried to inform me as best possible.






I've picked up food from them a couple times around breaks when I was a little tight on money. The staff that helped me was very nice and explained everything to me pretty well. I don't depend on it but it has helped me be a little more stress free when I had a lot going on. 



Good




"I think that it's pretty nice, it's very nice and convenient for students who haven't had time to eat before leaving or don't have enough money to go out and get food."


When I first started coming to UWT I would struggle financially and it was hard to find affordable food. The pantry helped me with that
It's very open and easy to access no matter how busy my schedule is. Plus the process is very quick and easy.






Decent. Lack of products last year 2023. Inconsistent
Great! 


"i had some food, my friend grabbed it."



"Very nice, it comes in handy when I can't buy groceries "
"It’s good, mostly adequate "



It was very helpful and easy to use!


I've only used it once but it was very easy to use. The food selection was nice as I was struggling that week.
I think it was great to provide these resources 






"It's closed when I try and go.  When I have been able to get in, its mostly empty or containing products I do not use or need"


Absolutely love the food pantry although I think we should have the opportunity to visit twice a week instead of just one time.

it was helpful getting food that I can eat at campus

My experience using the food pantry resource is great! I get to have access to food that my tuition pays for.
N/A




"Easy to start going, always has good and fresh food!"

All of their works were kind and understanding; actively trying to help students! 

An awesome experience! Met very nice people and will definitely be coming again!


Good.
"This resource is very useful, and my experience was great."
It is good to have it. Helps a lot to cover my living cost. The only comment I have is about the attitude and work approach of the Food Pantry team. I felt that they don't feel themselves in the position of helping or serving students who are entitled to this service. I would recommend to help those working in the Food Pantry to have more sense about equity and inclusion. 
Fair. I get to bring food to my family.






Always appreciative. It would be nice to know the resupply days prior to going. 




"Great, every time I am completely grateful for such a resource. It has certainly helped me this last year and currently still does.  "


"The Pantry is always neatly organized and managed by kind staff, I have only used a couple times but it was a good experience."
It was inconsistent the few times I tried to use it.
Very good choices of food and accessibility to everyone.
The food that they provide to the students. 



"The food pantry is great, although I wish there was more fresh food and rice"
It was nice and helpful I don't have time to cook at home as it takes up too much of my study time so I go to first Gen but I went once to the food pantry it was nice the people were kind and explained are limitations on how much we could get and how the whole thing works!~







"Great for getting food, especially of one is financially challenged "
no option for none. not using any

Decent


A great experience and was super helpful! 








Great experience! 

"The staff were very helpful, the service was easy to understand, and I felt comfortable using this resource."


Great able to save money on meals I’d otherwise have to buy on my limited income. Also saves me time so that I can study.




"It was easy and simple, good experience with some fresh food."




It was very helpful 


To be honest I haven't used any but I have been inside the food pantry.
Good.  Add a posting to when deliveries are coming in







"I came there to pick up a menstrual kit, my impression was the pantry is quite small."


I have never used any of these as I feel as they are not advertised enough to students who don’t live on campus.
"It was good. I do wish there were healthier options, even if not fresh produce."


never

Good



Nice and welcoming 
"Its good, wish they had more ready-to-eat options. Or, that the campus had a kitchen that I could take these items to and prepare them."
It’s great!




Great!
It saved me from starving because I had to use the rest of my money for parking. 


"I go to the food pantry almost every week because I don’t have enough money to buy essential items (I mean I kinda do but my parents financially support me and I don’t want to burden them). Sometimes they don’t have the stuff I want, but I till appreciate that students can use this."









Food
Microwave 
"It was a long time ago and I had placed an order (when that was an option) to pick up a bag and they did not have my order on file, so it was a little awkward. I don't even remember where the pantry is now, that was so long ago."

Good













Good experience was very quickly able to get what I needed when I went.




It was good. Stated improvements in other surveys
Excellent 


Like it  




Pretty good! I got food!


I have gone to the cupboard and it was a great experience. easy to use and a no judgement atmosphere. well organized. 





Very good!



"Great, very helpful."


Great.
Great. There are always great food products and other helpful things available at the pantry.










"hit or miss when I've been if there is anything I want/needed, but loved having the option of it. Haven't been in a while, might check it out again."



I love that everyone will be helped to stay nourished






Kind staff. Always a blessing

"At the food pantry, i have always felt welcome. Sometimes i feel stigma around food insecurity but i know that it is what i need to do to get food into my body."








"Overall very positive. I have to be strategic about when I go due to many things going quickly. More frequent restocking, even if it was less at a time, might help. The supplies offered are good"


Good
"Great but often empty by the time I arrive. Very popular in demand resource, I wish it had more instant foods students can eat for lunch, instead of cooking."
There was not a none option. I’m new and don’t know about the resources available to me on campus. 

It was a very enjoyable experience. 


good



It's great!

It was good and simple. I was able to get food.
Helped me get food when I was low on money.


Fast and amazing



"It was a nice way to get some food for free, should be promoted more than it is for how useful it can be "


"I very much appreciate this resource; however, I feel it would be more beneficial to have a dining hall. "



Great. No complaints. 

It was awesome 



It was nice being able to eat a quick snack as I was very hungry
Experience has been great
Great service plenty of food






"It feels kind of too strict. It feels like they're putting limits on absolutely everything. Also, they stopped giving out spaghetti, which is disappointing. The other pastas that they have don't really fit into many recipes. "



"My experience with the food pantry was great, I have only used twice. "





"Good, but it supplies always seemed quite low. More volume was needed."






It went well





It was nice to use when I wanted to save money on food






The people who run the pantry are very friendly helpful.  They make sure each student gets what they need without spreading themselves too thin to ensure each student who utilizes the pantry has equal access. It is a very well run amenity 

"When I am hungry, I can eat a snack without money."







"It was ok, often out of many options"



I went once but it was Limited 





Amazing 

We need more food there


"It was a good experience, got enough food for a week so I was covered in terms of food till I decided to come back then restarted the weekly cycle."

It was very stocked and helped on a day that I hadn't ate in a bit
It went fine.
Very good













"The experience is good. However, i once went to the small pantry near the first generation office, and before i do anything, i was intrigued by someone sitting there. They were telling me “ people have food insecurity “ and I should not take food, or i should my own lunch. This felt very disrespectful and unnecessary.  Why would i walk there and tell everyone i have food insecurity? That was very uncomfortable for me and my friend. "



"Good, but pantry was far away from my car so had to haul heavy food a distance. Maybe have multiple throughout campus with equal stock. Not rely on donations so supply is the same throughout locations. "
"Whenever I go to the pantry, I struggle to find groceries that suit my Indian dietary preferences. I suggest stocking items that cater to regional tastes to better accommodate diverse needs."


Great
