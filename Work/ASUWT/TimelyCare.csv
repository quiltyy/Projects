It was good. I could experience the service completely free of cost from the comfort of my home. It was immediately accessible.





"It was great, to have someone there to talk to you when you needed it. I honestly love how if you ever have a really stressful day you’re able to talk to a therapist right away. The therapist I talked to was helpful and gave me good advice. "










The response time is quick and helpful.


































"good , would recommend to others "



































"I created my account at the start of Fall quarter, and I have yet to use it any of it's services "




"Along with therapy, the TimelyCare app has proved to be so useful when I am not discussing my mental health with my therapist by giving me simple things to read that can help me improve my sleep schedule, study habits, and eating habits too. "















































































I was expecting to book an in-person appointment with a medical professional. 







"I enjoy using TimelyCare, and I'm very grateful that this resource is offered at UW Tacoma. It's so easy to schedule appointments and get support without the usual stress and hurdles. Being able to connect with professionals right from campus has been a real blessing. "
























Very helpful

The doctor was nice. I had first degree burn on my right hand and he assured me that it was going to be okay. It was such a relief and I appreciate I can use this for free.

It’s been alright 








































Good











"I got connected to a professional and got my issue dealt with. Super helpful, especially as a student without personal health insurance"























"Very useful for medication bridge refills, not useful for psychiatry. PCP refuses to treat psych diagnosis, and referrals on the app are not available. "





























Helped me get quick medical advice.









Good






















My experience with Timely care was great. They were expeditious and thorough.
