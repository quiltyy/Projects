"It’s been helpful, but I wish it was more interactive."









































































Good










Everyone is pretty open and supportive 









I didn't use this service much. I was recommended by a friend and only went so far as emailing this service.




























I talked to a counselor during a hard time in my life and they were really helpful in hearing me out 


















A very convenient service that is nice to use.















Have not currently used any health and wellness services at UWT.




















.


































































"I didn’t, but this survey made me choose one. "









It’s easy and helpful to use.




































N/A























































helpful



"if I'll be honest, I haven't used any of these resources but there is a ""none"" option"












Very helful







Have not used any services













never









Fine

























It was nice not having to pay for Covid vaccine



















Nothing to note.









It was good











"There wasn't an option for none, I don't use any.    "





















My experiences have always been great and beneficial









































It was amazing 









































"Was no ""None"" option"


















I don't - survey would not let me continue.















"I didn't use this service, but there was no way to say so.      "









Fun



I went there once when I was really facing challenging situations at home. I liked them a lot. They patiently answered to all my questions. They helped me to learn about the resources which are useful for the huskies care.
