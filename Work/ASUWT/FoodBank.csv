Nourish Food Bank Truck: What was your experience like using that resource?
































I only used it once bc of my roommate so I don’t have personal experience but the food was yummy









It was pretty cool













Greta experience! I’m internally grateful for these resources 
Food got expired or molded the next day most of the time

Good






I watched my friend use it because vae needed food and it seemed fine.





Once a week but definitely lots of helpful supplies. 







Very helpful and kind hearted people 


"I love going there, everyone is so thoughtful "
Very helpful staff











It's okay. The lines can be long and challenging. Rarely gluten free options. 







Amazing! I really love that this is on campus.













I go weekly. I appreciate the additional resource alongside the pantry. My only complaint is the freshness of food like the veggies and meat.
"Great!! Good food, great quantity. "
It was a little difficult to find at first but I think this is a great resource for students who can have the experience of grocery shopping but without having to pay all the expenses for shopping for needs. 



"The food bank truck had a large variety of foods, I really like how the had fresh foods and meat."






I appreciated getting necessary food for each week

Easy to use and understand 















My experience was great.
























"Have yet to use this, I knew of it but couldn't figure out when and where it is located on campus."






















"Its cool, I can get food everyweek"


"Very friendly, encouraging, well-stocked, and overall pretty enjoyable. There was no stigma in me gathering food. Just wished it was more utilized since all of the uneaten food gets thrown out."




I always find what I need from the food banks.

"I’m pleased there’s a truck! The Food Pantry isn’t enough, because you never know if you will get food or not. The Food Bank is more predictable and I love that! So cool to have that on campus."

































"I started using it just a few weeks ago. It's been really helpful. Aside from the stable canned products, the others were almost like a surprise, because you don't know what to expect. "









More selection













"I've been getting food from Nourish for the past couple weeks now and it's been really helpful. I can only work ~15 hours a week so, even though I don't usually get a ton from the nourish truck, what stuff I do pick out goes a long way to helping supplement my groceries. Staff is nice and I can tell that they just want to get food to everyone who comes. "



















"Decent, only us d it once"







It's a nice resource but often I've gotten expired food that resulted in food poisoining.







I've used it a few times and they always have a great selection of items to choose from.







"helpful, better than the pantry for food stuff"

"Great experience, extremely kind people"

Easy and well marketed!

Very helpful for getting help over food issues 






It is great to have this service on campus. Great team efforts on every Thursdays and meets my needs. Having less worries about food is having more energy to focus on my study. 
















I enjoy using them a lot and I think that they help a lot of people.

It was alright. There was a couple of foods that I did not check that they were expired. 




















Everyone was really really nice especially Mrs. liz










Good











They had a very nice staff and helped me get groceries to eat.














Really good


never








I appreciate that everything is free and they've been able to fill the gaps when I wasn't able to make it to the grocery store. Although I wish you could know beforehand what they would have that week and that there were more meat & dairy options



Great as well.



I get a lot of fresh foods from food bank on Thursdays. I truly appreciate the people who donate.












Really good



















"It was fine, suggested improvements in other surveys"
























Great.
























I love the nourish food bank truck. My experiences have always been good










It was a smooth and easy process getting the food.

Great.lots of resources.


"Every week the people that work the Nourish truck are friendly, understanding, and just amazing individuals. "









More food than pantry

"I have not accessed this, but I was required to select an option to submit. Additionally, there was no option to select graduate student on the previous page so I selected senior. "




Another great resource if you are in need of some food!





I really enjoyed that we students had access to the food bank truck. 

"Haven't used, but plan on using this. "
It was amazing 














































Haven't used it before.















Amazing 

"Need fresh food there, have encountered more expired food due to which i gets sick"


"It was good, they had alot of items last time i went that I used."











I was able to get food and goods that I needed




Pretty good the people were chill





"It's an outstanding resource. The staff there are incredibly kind and generous, consistently delivering excellent service regardless of the season. I deeply appreciate their dedication and hard work. Thank you."

It was overall a good experience.
