Ok













































It was fairly straightforward to use.



















I just grabbed condoms from the bathrooms in tioga library 


never






"Great, wish there were more size options. Condoms aren't a ""one size fits all"" item."



































Saved money on condoms.








































It was convenient and provided me with supplies I needed.

I like access to free condoms in the bathrooms because it is discreet. 




I did not know we had this and think it would be great to know more about it.















Very useful



























"The free supplies are a great resource at UWT. The basic sex supplies can be found in the restrooms, which students can just grab as they need. This is a very discreet and simple process. Additionally, if other supplies are needed, they can be asked for online by filling out the form and provided upon arrival. I'm rarely on campus but this resource was nice to learn about.
