Psychological & Wellness Services (PAWS): What was your experience like using that resource?
"Went to group therapy there and it was nice. Smaller group than I would have imagined so I wonder if that was an advertising issue. Originally went in for therapy services, was told I would be put on a waitlist, never heard back."













Not great. I think my issues (like many others) stemmed from the detatchment that came out of covid. Only being able to to meet on zoom was weird and unhelpful 



It was okay 













I like it for the alternative testing









Is was nice and helpful talking to the counsellor







It was okay but I was very disappointed that I was dropped from my appointments in the same email that I was notified that I needed to register for autumn classes

"Amazing, love the staff and therapists available. "










Nice

Very helpful



Really insightful in terms of figuring out my mental boundaries and reorienting myself.
My experience with PAWS was eye opening. 

Everyone is nice and very helpful. Only issue is that appointments are very limited.
Very good! Everything and everyone was very supportive and easy to set up appointments.













Good. I felt supported and didn’t have the burden of financial stress or guilt looming over me. It helps knowing I have somewhere to go when I’m not doing well. 



"It was my first time ever using it, and it went pretty well. The person that was helping me was really patient and listened to any of my concerns."
"I found it to be a really helpful and efficient resource. The person at the front desk is very sweet and it made the whole experience less intimidating for me. The rooms are therapeutic and the counselors seem to do their job well. It’s always helpful to have someone that can listen to you when you need it. The psychologist I met that helped me set up a counseling session made me feel cared for. And I really appreciated her, and the feedback she gave. My counselor was a good listener and was there for me when I needed her."






I had a highly positive experience with PAWS when I utilized it as a resource. I went to the Build your Social Confidence group and felt a sense of self improvement within myself. The group members were supportive and I didn’t feel excluded at all. I could see that the instructor and other students  genuinely cared about the success and well being of each other.







My experience using this resource was very useful. It helped my experience here at UWT be a lot easier.

"A wonderful experience. I did both individual and group therapy for a combined total of maybe 5 quarters?? I did try recently to visit again, but the wait times are quite long."
I had a great time and then I feel like my needs weren’t met when I was told to look elsewhere because my therapist said I was “fine” and that’s there’s “no issues to work on”. So I feel like that mental health wellness resource was kind of ripped out from underneath me which doesn’t feel very equitable. 
It was helpful. I will most likely try to have another meeting. I think it’s difficult that you can’t schedule a PAWS appointment days in advance. 










Good







PAWS was a great resource for me to use when I was in mental crisis
"Unfortunately, due to a shuffle of therapists in September I was dropped by mine. Didn't vibe that well with them to begin with, gave the impression that I wasn't ""Ill enough"" to be utilizing the program. "

























"It was an easy service to sign up to, and use immediately."
Amazing. This is my 6th quarter at PAWS. I have been achieving my goals thanks to this support system.











I came to this school with a lot of mental health concerns and I was able to find a therapist that works with me and still is working with me till this day. I can say that my mental health has improved greatly than if I didn’t use this service. I am very grateful to have used this service and I will continue to do so as long as it’s needed.







"They have been an excellent professional support and instrumental in my success with my education, work, and life balance. "












"Told me I was ineligible for 1:1 counseling since I didn't have any extraordinary traumatic experiences. I'll be revisiting for their group sessions in Spring quarter. Otherwise the staff member and the trainee were all very nice, supportive, and conversational."




I used it a couple of times and it really help me better find out who I really am. 










It was nice to have the option of having a safe place to go to for any wellness needs and for all options to be free. 
"Pretty good, the experience was solid working with the professionals"

I haven't used any services. The survey does not give people the option to select nothing.
"Good, the therapy I got has been useful."


PAWS was a positive experience for me. I’m usually not the type to open up but using this service helped me to do so that way they could help me. I was able to reduce stress and manage my thoughts and emotions better afterwards.

















It's been good. The consaltant(?) is really kind and patient. 





I was in group counseling in Spring 2023. It was nice to have a regular outlet or people to talk to and get feedback about stuff going on in my life and be able to try and support others as well. I am not sure that I would do it again personally because I think I just need more one on one counseling. When I initially reached out to PAWS in Winter or Spring quarter 2023 I was trying to see an individual counselor/therapist with them but they said they did not have room for me.
I have been to PAWS once and was greeted by inviting staff that I felt cared for me
Good
Staff was supportive and welcoming






"It was good however takes long too get an appointment, felt like there should be more people for the amount of volume of need they have "


Good until i had to stop because it was not in person and i had an incident with a counselor 
It was okay









Excellent. 














I asked about autism signs and the therapist never even suggested I might be autistic or adhd.

"Really wonderful, I was going through a time of really severe anxiety and PAWS helped me develop skills to manage it. I know that if I needed to go back that I would be able to at any time"







"Good! They are very friendly. However, it is hard to get an appointment as there aren't many practitioners but a high demand."














Very helpful in mitigating negative thoughts and low self esteem





N/A




Easy to start going and very helpful.

They were all very respectful and responsive!
















It was a pretty good experience 






I like it a lot and I think that it is very helpful








I haven't bit the bullet into actively using it I have looked into it.





"Very nice, I recommend everyone use it"


The therapist seemed inexperience 


"It was really good, they were super helpful during a time I was struggling mentally with problems at home. "




"I actually have not used any of these services yet, but the question requires an answer so I randomly selected an answer."












Pretty good









"It is difficult to get the timing to see PAWs, short sign in windows low staff"


A wonderful service that helped me through a tough time in 2022.



I liked my experience for the most part. I wished that sessions were longer though and in-person.


"I have not utilized any services, but this was not an option.   I am also a grad student, which also was not an option. "




never



"N/A - I haven’t used this, but I had to select one in order to continue the survey."


"Love it, I really needed a therapist, school is highly stressful and its nice to be able to speak with someone about things."














Always good


Good but never reached out for second request for therapy. 



Mixed experience. It is an awkward set-up process. I don't like that you have to email day-of during open times.








It has been extremely helpful when I needed some help with my mental well being. 





I love them and it feels very welcoming

"I haven't used this service yet, but I plan to."
Good.
















It was okay but I did not use it for very long






Just started looking into it. 
It just isn’t for me because of the all virtual format. I need the in person face to face connection for therapy services







Really great. I see a counselor there regularly who is competent and supportive. 
I found it very helpful to have someone listen to my problems.




I have not used any resources due to time. If I were to use in the future I have been thinking about the Psychological and Wellness Services.






Long wait for appointment 
It was good. They were able to get me set up with someone quickly during a time I really needed it. 



Wonderful. Offered a listening ear when I needed



I have not used it. It was a requirement to select one or more to submit.

It was great!
I loved it! I just wish there was more time availability at PAWS- it’s hard to find a time that I am available where PAWS is also available. 


"I haven't used this, but this question doesnt have a NA answer for those who dont use campus services."

















"Very useful, helped me get through a depressed part of my life."






"They were nice, its a very good resource to have available "


I think that the psychologists there should be a little bit more trained in a variety of areas when dealing with students due to the fact that we struggle with a variety of issues that we need advice on and resolutions for.




















it was okay






It was really good. I recommend it to anyone struggling. They helped me through a lot. I can't stress enough how amazing the people they are. 
Very good. My only regret is not accessing it sooner.




















Very friendly and knowledgeable

"Excellent, though short-lived care. Difficult to find outside providers after counseling/referral due to my insurance and post-COVID scarcity of providers. Enjoyed Self-Expression through Art, but feel that more time should be offered per session."



It was fine. Felt rushed through the process because of the waiting list and short staff.
"It has been very beneficial and easy. I simply was referred to the Office of Student Advocacy who then referred me to PAWS. I called and Emma was so kind and helpful to get me in for the same-day appointment for an intake. Then at the end of my appointment, she mentioned that I would be scheduled with a regular therapist based on my needs and I have been seeing Crystal regularly since. "







It’s been a great resource for me it’s nice to have someone on campus since I already work and go to school here for most the day.

I don't - survey would not let me continue.
























"I have not completed two sessions, but it was a great experience so far. I had one meeting to get questions and answers from me and one session where i got to meet whoever will work with me. They were all nice and professional and made me feel safe. "



"Good, but unhappy with a new counselor would come every quarter. Had to rebuild rapport and do new patient intakes all the time so I stopped using the service. "
