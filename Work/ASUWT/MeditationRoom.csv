Campus Meditation Room: What was your experience like using that resource?
"Pretty good, no complaints bc it's fairly simple"






























































Nice 




I just used it as a quiet space to relax and reflect
Just a quiet space to reorient myself








































































I felt calm and more collected after using the campus meditation room. Doing something as simple as closing your eyes and relaxing can make you feel less anxious about schoolwork. 







It was peaceful and relaxing. 
I have not used any of these resources but I would like to use some at some point.





It was a great place to take a break and have some peace especially during finals. 



"Great, I’m thankful this is a resource at uw tacoma "






















"I wanted to share my experience using the Campus Meditation Room. It has become a sanctuary for me amidst the demands of university life. The serene atmosphere and the opportunity for quiet reflection have been invaluable. Utilizing this resource has not only provided a mental break but also enhanced my overall well-being. If you haven't already, I highly recommend exploring the peaceful haven of the Campus Meditation Room."



















Great addition for a safe and comfortable space for meditation 







this service is relaxing when you want to have a unique space to yourself this meditation room is excellent to have your own space
It was very clean and peaceful and the environment was perfect 































"I actually haven't used this resource, but there was no option to not have used a campus wellness service."



























"Very calm, I went with a friend a few months ago and it was a nice experience"

"Good. I think there should be more information on intent, benefits, history, techniques, and how to respect the spaces."



























"Great, I pray in it the space can get crowded, and it becomes really tight "













Helps to relax

"I haven’t used any, but there was no option for “none” and this is a required question."

































































Quiet and respectful place to reflect in.
I think this is an amazing resource especially when the quarter becomes stressful and other financial and family issues are hard as well. This room always brings me comfort and safety









































It was amazing

Peaceful. More places could use a room like this 




Using the meditation room was a good experience. People knew how to take turns when using it and it's a spacious enough.
